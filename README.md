## Technologies and tools

Photoshop | Google Web Designer | HTML5 | CSS | JavaScript | Web designer docs | cloudinary

### Tasks

- **01 Google Web Designer**
  - Published locally as a zip file.
  - I created a 300x600 banner based on the specfications given in the task.
  - I chose to use the Dynamic Remarketing Ad template. I felt this had the functionality that I needed for this task.

**Challenges**
Google web designer - this was my first encounter with GWD I was able to create my add with the aid of the documentation from the help section.

I hit a wall trying to implement that last two features.

- Dynamic exiting on click of the hotspot. I did see in the devTools console `[studio.sdk] Exit "Product_1_url" invoked.` so I did manage to trigger it on click but there was not redirect to the url.
- Conditionally hiding `"Product_x_price"` that were the same as `"Product_x_salePrice"`.

With a bit more guidence and and the opportunity to work with GWD more I am confident that I would be able to over come the learning curve of this tool.

- **02 General dev skills**
  - Created two button icons in Photoshop.
  - Created a 200x600 banner using html, css and javascript.
  - Utilised flexbox for positioning.
  - Through a combination of of event listeners and DOM manipulation I was able to achieve a lightweight carousel banner.
  - All images as well as the button icons were optimised for web use with photoshop to decrease file size.

### Reflections

This test was both challenging and fun, I feel it gave me a glimpse of the sort of thing I would be working on as a Frontend developer in the Rich Media department and I can definitely see a chance to level up my skills and learn a lot about the creation of banners. Google web desinger was the most challening part of this test, but it is definitely a tool I would like to have the opportunity to understand and use more.

- My process for debugging is as follows: console.log the issue, if that was too vauge or the error did no present itself clearly I moved to using the Chrome debugger.
